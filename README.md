## Longitudinal analyses on MI BMI data

### Objective: Students are asked to analyze the data collected during the Cybathlon training of pilot F1 and to highlight the learning correlates.

### Data description:
Data has been recorded with 16-channel EEG amplifier (g.USBamp, g.Tec) at 512 Hz. Electrodes were placed accordingly to the 10-20 standard layout. Position and order of the electrodes are reported in Figure 1.
The provided data covers a period of 3 months of training (11 sessions). During the period, the pilot performed “offline” (calibration, no real feedback) and “online” (with real feedback) runs. The number of trials for each run may be different. Event codes are reported in Figure 3.

### The task and the visual paradigm:
The pilot was asked to perform 2 motor imagery tasks: both hands vs. both feet. The visual paradigm exploited during the training is illustrated in Figure 2. The color of the cue indicated which motor imagery task to perform (e.g., both hands or both feet). During the calibration runs, the bar associated to the cue was automatically filled. During the online runs, the bars were filled accordingly to the output of the classifier.

### Assignments:
1. Analyze the data with the techniques provided in class
2. Extract the metrics to evaluate learning (including but not limited to):
◦ At the neurophysiological level
◦ At the application level (i.e., BCI command accuracy)
3. Report and discuss the temporal evolution of such metrics
4. [Optional] Based on the temporal evolution of learning correlates, find and discuss the best moments to re-calibrate the classifier
